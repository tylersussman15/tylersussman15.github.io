    <p>
      I completed this project by setting up Active Directory
      Domain Services on a Windows Server virtual machine
      and configuring it as the domain controller for a new domain.
      I installed DNS, verified network connectivity, and successfully
      joined both a second server and a Windows 11 client to the domain,
      confirming that all systems could authenticate and communicate within the network.

      Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Active Directory,
      domain controllers, and Windows Server administration. It helped me better
      understand how centralized user management, authentication, and networking
      work in real-world enterprise environments.
