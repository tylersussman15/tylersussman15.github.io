      I completed this project by configuring a Windows Server 2025 virtual machine
      as a domain environment for savn.local. I created and verified the domain setup
      by checking the domain information in PowerShell and confirming system activity
      through Task Manager while the server was running in VirtualBox.

      Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Windows Server administration
      in a virtual lab, including how domain environments are identified and monitored.
      It also helped me connect the idea of centralized authentication and domain structure
      to what administrators actually see and validate during real system setup and testing.
